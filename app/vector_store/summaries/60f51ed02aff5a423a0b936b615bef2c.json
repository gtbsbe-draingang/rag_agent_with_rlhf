  "summary": "This document outlines an advanced architecture for an adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using LLaMA as the base language model. The system incorporates real-time user feedback to continuously improve its performance. Key concepts and components include:\n\n1. Real-Time Feedback Collection:\n   - Explicit feedback (user ratings, comments)\n   - Implicit feedback (user behavior)\n   - Feedback quality filtering to ensure high-quality inputs\n\n2. Adaptive Retraining:\n   - Uses parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)\n   - Allows for quick model updates without full retraining\n   - Supports multiple specialized adapters for different domains or tasks\n\n3. Dynamic Knowledge Base:\n   - Uses PGVector for storing and retrieving embeddings\n   - Allows real-time updates to the knowledge base without downtime\n   - Implements a quality score system for vector entries\n\n4. LangChain Integration:\n   - Used as the framework to orchestrate the RAG workflow\n   - Provides structured interface to the model and vector database\n\n5. Continuous Learning Pipeline:\n   - Frontend handles queries and feedback collection\n   - Backend trainer monitors feedback and triggers model updates\n   - Separate retriever updater for managing vector store content\n\n6. Ethical Safeguards and Robustness:\n   - Maintains a base aligned model (e.g., LLaMA-2 fine-tuned with RLHF)\n   - Implements feedback moderation and guardrails\n   - Includes safety tests and rollback procedures\n\n7. Implementation Details:\n   - Uses LLaMA-2 (13B-chat or 7B-chat) with quantization techniques\n   - Employs Hugging Face Transformers, PEFT library, and PyTorch\n   - Supports local hosting and efficient GPU resource management\n\n8. Scalability and Deployment:\n   - Supports horizontal scaling of inference service\n   - Implements efficient update cycles (e.g., daily or weekly)\n   - Considers security, privacy, and compliance requirements\n\nThe architecture aims to create a self-improving chatbot that balances adaptability with stability, ensuring factual accuracy and ethical standards while continuously learning from user interactions. It emphasizes efficiency, modularity, and responsible AI practices throughout the system's design and operation.",
